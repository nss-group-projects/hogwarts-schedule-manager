 # Hogwart's Schedule Manager

 This is an early debugging exercise you can do with the students.

 ### How to run
 Copy this repo as a template or fork into the cohort org.  
 Clone down.  
 Debug in your IDE.  

 ### Flow
 I will usually just encourage students to debug while I'm sharing screen. Squash a bug then move to the next. I also try to make sure everyone gets involved. There's a tendency for those who understand the process to take the session over. Don't let them do that. This is an opportunity to break some ice between you and the cohort. 
 
 Above all... Have fun with it!
