## Hogwarts Debugging Workshop 🐛⚡

######  ✔️ *Curriculum target: Client-side - Book 2: debugging*

Another school year is on the horizon, and Hogwarts has to know which students are scheduled for which classes. Dobby has been murdered, and the house elves are revolting. Hogwarts has nothing the goblins want in terms of payment, so we've been retained to create a school tracking application. We've inherited a codebase that is Tom Riddled with errors though... Let's get to debugging!

📑 For this exercise, you will need to go into the codebase and break things. Good bugs to introduce at this point are as follows:

- Spelling errors
- Values not being returned
- Data errors
- Import/export errors
- Reserved keyword errors
- Logic errors (conditionals, loops)
- Reassigning to `const`
- Double == vs triple ===
- Cannot read property of `undefined`
